## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent technology and innovation. This color gives a feeling of progress and knowledge acquisition.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), to give a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE29E2). The choice to shift the hue strongly toward purple moves it into another band of association, away from simply duplicating the primary, into imagination and futuristic thinking, for a jolt of expressivity.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, will create a precise and contemporary look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to ensure readability and modernity for workshop details, testimonials and other details.
- Use modern, flat icons to represent different sections of the workshop and benefits. Use iconography sparingly, reserving it for where it really improves UX or is specifically called for in the copy.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations on button hover and page scrolling to enhance user experience.
